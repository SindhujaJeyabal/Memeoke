<h1> MEMEOKE </h1>
<p>
     Memeoke is a web-based application which simulates the offline karaoke experience by allowing users to sing their favorite songs online while infusing it with a contemporary twist by serving up memes and animated GIFs in the background that are contextually related to the song being sung. Users can also share their experience through the generation of a shortened URL which will lead other users directly to the song page on the Memeoke website, without having to navigate through the menus to get there.
